SlicerCMF is currently being developed as a 3DSlicer extension bundle. In order to use it, please [download the latest 3DSlicer preview](https://download.slicer.org/) version and install through the extension manager.

You can use previous SlicerCMF custom packages through the [DCBIA Downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/dentistry-image-computing/Download) site. Please, keep in mind these packages are no longer being maintained and no support will be provided for them.

The source code is available from the [DCBIA GitHub repository](https://github.com/DCBIA-OrthoLab). Please email us with any questions, or file an issue on GitHub.
